# Challenge
<p> Due to the lack of time I'm not happy with this project.
  Some Xpaths and CSS selector are not nice and some classes should be divided into smaller one(f.ex. Repository Page class).
  Accepting pull request is not done but instead of it I follow the Comit to new branche-> pull request-> merge process in the third test.
  To get test running simply change the userName and password variables in the TestBase class, the user shoud not have many solutions because opening them is done from the quick acces menu on the main page.</p>
